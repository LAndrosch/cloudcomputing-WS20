## GitFlow

Using the GitFlow approach it should be made sure that branches are only merged into specific other branches. 

- **Feature branches** are only allowed to be merged into **develop**

- **release** is only allowed to be merged into **develop** and **master**

- **hotfix** is only allowed to be merged into **master** and **develop**
